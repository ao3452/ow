Overlay Weaver - An Overlay Construction Toolkit

About
-----

Overlay Weaver is an overlay construction toolkit, which supports
overlay algorithm designers in addition to application developers.

For application developers, the toolkit provides a common API for
higher-level services such as distributed hash table (DHT) and
multicast.  Applications relying on the common API depend no specific
transport protocol, database implementation and routing algorithm.

The toolkit provides multiple routing algorithms, Chord, Kademlia,
Koorde, Pastry and Tapestry.  These algorithms could be implemented
only in hundreds lines of code because of routing layer decomposition.
Routing layer under the higher-level services has been decomposed into
multiple components, routing driver, routing algorithm and messaging
service.  The decomposition also facilitates implementation of a new
algorithm.  A newly implemented algorithm can be tested, evaluated and
compared on emulator, which can host hundreds of thousands of virtual
nodes. It enables large-scale emulation and fair comparison between
algorithms.
